# Currency calculator

A currency calculator web app made on bootstrap and Ionic framework. Part of a little server - client experiment along the [X-rate scraper server](https://github.com/mauriciojorta/X-rates-scraper-server).

## Features

1. A exchange rate calculator for a set of 12 currencies (including the most valuable ones such as the US Dollar, the Euro and the British Pound).
2. A list page with the exchange rates lists of each currency with other coins.
